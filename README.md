Issues:
- I had an issue with the hovers over the boxes. I kept playing around with the mouseenter event but couldn't figure it out with the resources I was using. Instead I made it change colors when you clicked on each box.
- I had trouble centering my container. Not sure if I'm missing something to align the boxes in the center but I tried using different flex properties in CSS and nothing worked. 
- Other than this, no major issues.
